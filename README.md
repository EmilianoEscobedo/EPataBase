# :books: EP Data Base 

This was my first project using PHP. I applied the Model-View-Controller design pattern and object orientation. It also includes a relational database on MySQL and the phpMyAdmin tool. <br><br>
I learned a lot and it was a big challenge, since I had never built anything on the server side. I learned about HTTP protocols and front control techniques for better security.

<br><br>

As a result, it is a simple, user-friendly web application that is adaptable to all devices.
